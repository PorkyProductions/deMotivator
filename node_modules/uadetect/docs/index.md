## WELCOME!

HI!  We're so happy that you chose to use UADetect. Over the next few document's we'll show you how to use UADetect, and all of it's components. We promise it won't be too hard.

You'll need to have node.js installed on your machine, as well as npm. You can download node and npm from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). If you're wondering which version to use, LTS is the best option for most people.

### Module Bundler

Becuase this package is targeted at the browser, you'll need to have a browser installed, as well as a module bundler. We reccomend using [Vite](https://vitejs.dev) because it's super simple, and really fast as well. But, you can use any bundler you want, such as [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/), or [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org/).
