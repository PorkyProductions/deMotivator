# How to contribute to (de)Motivator
## In 4 Easy Steps

### Step 1: Don't

We are an open source project, but most of the development is handled by PorkyProductions. You can still contribute, and we LOVE new ideas for insults and stuff, but be aware that most development is handled by PorkyProductions.

### Step 2: Decide what the problem is

#### **Did you find a bug?**

* **Do not open up a GitHub issue if the bug is a security vulnerability
  in DMV**, and instead to refer to our Communtiy Guidelines for contact info.

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/PorkyProductions/-de-Motivator/issues).

* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/PorkyProductions/-de-Motivator/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

#### **Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?**

* Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.

* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

* Before submitting, please read the [Community Guidelines](https://github.com/PorkyProductions/-de-Motivator/blob/86df32e8b494dc3c3fd56c9fe726f9a82ce98872/.github/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)

#### **Did you fix whitespace, format code, or make a purely cosmetic patch?**

Changes that are cosmetic in nature and do not add anything substantial to the stability, functionality, or testability of will generally  be accepted.

Open a PR and use the same guidelines as patching a bug

#### **Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?**

* Start writing code.

* Do not open an issue on GitHub until you have collected positive feedback from peers about the change. GitHub issues are primarily intended for bug reports and fixes.

#### **Do you have questions about the source code?**

* Don't ask
* Figure it out yourself
* We are very busy

#### **Do you want to contribute to the documentation?**

* Open a PR and follow the same guidelines as stated above

### Step 3: Submit the changes

Submit your changes in the `issues` section, or submit your PR, and wait for further review. Who knows? Maybe your code will enter our project :)

### Step 4: Failure

If your code gets denied or deleted, don't fret! Read the guidelines, and try to find another issue
